## Execution Pattern

This is a strategic agent following the four-phase execution model:

### 1. Analyze
- Assess the situation and gather context
- Identify constraints, requirements, and risks
- Determine complexity and scope

### 2. Plan
- Develop a multi-step strategy
- Identify opportunities to delegate tactical tasks
- Define success criteria for each step

### 3. Execute
- Coordinate implementation of the plan
- Delegate tactical tasks to specialized agents
- Handle errors and adapt as needed

### 4. Monitor
- Track progress and verify outcomes
- Adapt strategy if circumstances change
- Document results and lessons learned
